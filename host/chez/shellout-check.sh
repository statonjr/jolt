# shellout-check.sh — jolt-core may hand the shell external programs, not
# filesystem operations.
#
# WHY THIS GATE EXISTS. jolt.host/sh is Chez's `system`: on Windows that runs
# the command string through cmd.exe, which shares almost nothing with a POSIX
# shell. `mkdir -p a/b` there does not create a/b's parents — cmd's mkdir has no
# options and takes a LIST of paths, so it creates a directory literally named
# `-p` and reports nothing wrong. mv, rm, touch, test and find are not commands
# at all. So a resolver written in shell commands does not fail on Windows, it
# half-works: jolt v0.7.14 littered every project it ran in with a `-p`
# directory and a growing pile of `.part-` files that the failed `mv` never
# published, and its classpath cache could never hit.
#
# The fix was to do the filesystem work through filesystem calls (jolt.host
# mkdirs!/rename-file!/delete-file!/delete-tree!/file-mtime/list-dir), leaving
# the shell for the one thing that really is an external program: git. Jars
# extract in process through jolt.host/extract-zip! (jolt issue #988).
# That distinction is invisible in the source — a `(sh (str "rm -f " …))` reads
# exactly like a `(sh (str "git clone " …))` — so it is checked here rather than
# left to whoever adds the next one to remember which host they are on.
#
# The scan covers jolt-core/, which is the dependency resolver and the CLI: the
# code that runs on a user's machine before anything of theirs does. stdlib/ is
# deliberately out of scope — clojure.java.browse opening a URL through xdg-open
# IS a platform-specific program, and says so.

# The external programs jolt is allowed to run: git, a real dependency with no
# in-process equivalent (jolt has no git client). unzip left the list when jars
# began to extract in process (jolt issue #988).
