;; for every "what classes does this satisfy" question. value-host-tags (protocol
;; dispatch), instance?, isa?/supers/ancestors, and the exception hierarchy all
;; derive from the ONE table here instead of maintaining parallel hand-kept lists
;; that drift apart.
;;
;; The graph is keyed by canonical (FQN) class name -> its DIRECT super
;; interfaces/classes (also FQN). Transitivity is computed (jch-closure), so a row
;; lists only what a class directly extends/implements, matching the JVM source.
;;
;; It is OPEN: a library registers a class and its supers with
;; jolt.host/register-class-supers! (plus a class-arm in host-class.ss to map its
;; values to that class name), and every derived view picks the class up with no
;; core change. Loaded before records.ss so value-host-tags can derive from it.

;; canonical-name -> list of direct super canonical-names. Mutable + extensible.

;; corrupts under concurrent WRITES (the damage surfaces later inside the
;; collector, never as an error naming the table), and these two are memo caches on
;; the protocol-dispatch path, so every thread that dispatches fills them.
;;
;; jch-cache-mutex covers every MUTATION of jvm-class-parents, every WHOLE-TABLE
;; scan of it, both derived caches, and jch-graph-epoch. Single-key reads stay
;; unlocked, on the split rt.ss spells out for var-table — these are strong
;; general hashtables, so an unlocked reader walks consistent structure and the
;; worst it sees is a stale miss. That is not a nicety here: jch-tags is on the
;; protocol-dispatch path and jch-closure under it, so a mutex on the read would
;; sit on every protocol call in the program. Steady state is pure reads, so this
;; costs nothing once warm.
;;
;; jch-graph-epoch is the graph's generation, and it does two jobs.
;;
;; Invalidation is a hashtable-clear!, and a clear can be undone. jch-closure /
;; jch-tags compute outside the lock (the walk is not cheap and calls nothing that
;; needs one), so without a generation a walk that began before a jch-set-supers!
;; could publish its pre-change answer after the clear, and every later dispatch
;; would read it. A stale ancestry is a wrong isa? and a wrong protocol method,
;; and it would never expire. Each publish re-checks the generation it computed
;; against.
;;
;; It is also read by callers that derive a per-type answer from the graph and
;; want to revalidate with one fixnum compare instead of re-walking (jrdesc-ifc-of,
;; records.ss) — a deftype gains interfaces after its descriptor exists, and can
;; gain more later through extend-type. Bumped LAST, after the table is written
