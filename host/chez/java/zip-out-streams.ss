;; zip-out-streams.ss — java.util.zip.DeflaterOutputStream (JDK 21
;; DeflaterOutputStream.java), and the frame GZIPOutputStream builds on.
;;
;; Each stream is jolt's own "out-stream" (io-streams.ss): a jhost over a Chez
;; custom binary output port whose write! runs the body of the JDK's
;; write(byte[], off, len). write flushes the port after each call, so the
;; Deflater sees each write when the caller makes it, as in the JDK; io/copy,
;; transferTo and a Writer put bytes into the port directly, and those reach the
;; Deflater on flush, finish or close. write, flush, finish and close are
;; overridden for these streams, so the JDK's checks run when the caller calls,
;; and they take arguments as zip-base.ss does. with-open closes a stream through
;; its close method (io-streams.ss jolt-close), and io/writer's writer closes it
;; as well, so the end of the compressed data is written there. Slot 4 of the
;; out-stream state holds the zout record.
