;; at the library's top-level (during heap build), so both are available before
;; jolt_library_init returns.

;; point_size is the one that reaches the Clojure half of jolt.ffi. A library
;; image is not the build driver's image, so a driver that reads its own loaded
;; set as the library's leaves layout-size interned but UNBOUND at the call.
