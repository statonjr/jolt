# --- the gate ---------------------------------------------------------------
#
# A gate is only worth anything if an INCOMPLETE run cannot be read as a pass.
# Three things go wrong otherwise, and all three have happened:
#
#   1. make stops at the first failing target, so every target after it never
#      runs. Re-running a hand-picked subset afterwards prints per-target
#      success that looks exactly like the whole gate's.
#   2. `make test | tail` reports tail's status, and the log then ENDS on some
#      passing target's output — the failure scrolled past.
#   3. `make -i` exits 0 even when targets failed.
#
# So: the gate runs as a sub-make, a verdict line is printed either way (the log
# can never end on a passing target), the exit status is preserved, and a receipt
# naming the covered tree is written ONLY on a complete pass. `make gate-status`
# answers "is this working tree gated?" — which is not something to remember.

# corrected absolute-live-bytes measurement). Detection-free, no jolt boot.
# fibers-state-test.ss is the R2 dynamic-slice gate (per-fiber bindings/ns/txn;

# fibers-chan-test.ss is the R3 waiter-protocol gate (fiber <! / >! over the

# fibers-go-test.ss is the R4 gate (epic jolt-nvpr.5): go on fibers via the

# set (sections 4-7 through the host seam; the :default check loads the
# overlay).
# fibers-lock-test.ss is the object-monitor gate (jolt-3a87): `locking` and the
# bare monitor-enter/monitor-exit halves across a fiber switch. A monitor is the
# one lock in the runtime that wraps user code, so neither half of locks.ss's
# premise — short regions, never spanning a park — holds for it.
# async-io-thread-test.ss is the io-thread gate (jolt-579): core.async's third
# carrier. It runs with the pool pinned to ONE carrier, which is what makes "8
# bodies parked at the same time, all of them resuming" mean that a fiber released

# A frame from a CACHED namespace must report a source path that EXISTS. The cache
# used to compile a pid-unique temp and rename it away, so compile-file baked a
# path that died with the rename — which the R3 trace would then fail to resolve
# offsets against.

# Perf measurement: cold (recompile) vs warm (cache hit) for a multi-library
# require. Needs Maven jars locally; NOT in the default ci gate (timing budget).

# Perf probe for the print and pr value seams: 200000 values each through
# with-out-str. Guards the per-value *print-readably* override and the printer's
# fast path for runtime-owned types. Manual like aotcacheperf — the repo has no
# wall-clock assertions in its default gates, and a timing floor would be flaky
# on loaded CI. See the header of the script for how to read the numbers.
printperf:

# StringBuilder.append must stay amortised O(1). Asserts a SCALING RATIO rather
# than a wall-clock floor — 4x the appends should cost ~4x, not ~16x — so unlike
# the probes above it is meaningful on a loaded machine. Still manual, to keep
# the default gate free of timing. See the script header.
